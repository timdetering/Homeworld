/**********	INPUT PARAMETERS
*	GPName -	The game name. This value is predefined in the SIGS database
*				It is used to determine the next three parameters to pass
*				back to the calling application
*
*	GPIPAddr -	Returned value of the Gathering Place IP address
*				Defined in the SIGS database. Use a char that can hold
*				IP addresses of the format XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX
*	
*	GPInPort -	Returned value of the Gathering Place communication In Port
*				Defined in the SIGS database
*
*	GPOutPort -	Returned value of the Gathering Place communication Out Port
*				Defined in the SIGS database
*
*	pcProdDIR - The Installed path for the product, (must end in a '\')
*				Example:	c:\sierra\blackjak\
*
*	pcAppExe -	This is the full command to restart your EXE. You can include commandline
*				parameters to restart your exe. Avoid the '/' character.
*				Example:	c:\sierra\blackjak\blackjak.exe
*
*	hMainWnd -	The window handle to you main window. It will be used to make sure
*				we can shut down you APP when you get patched. By default it will be NULL
*				And we will try to calculate it ourself.
*
*
********	RETURN VALUES
*	DLL_EXIT_FOR_SELF_UPDATE -	This indicates there is a patch on the server
*								for the aplication. You should terminate as quickly
*								as possible. SIGSPat.exe will restart your app
*								when patching is complete.
*
*	DLL_EXIT_FAILED_TO_UPDATE - Validation failed for any number of reason. For
*								all accounts, Internet play is not available.
*
*	DLL_EXIT_CONTINUE_TO_CONNECT -	Everything has completed normally. You should
*								free SNWValid at this time.
